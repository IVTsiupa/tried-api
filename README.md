## Tried Application Description
Generally, Tried is a service, where people can
share their masterclasses, workshops, video courses and any other
kinds of online/offline activities. 

I am creating it for two reasons:
 1. Just for fun, because I enjoy coding
 2. I want to improve my web development skills and knowledge.


## Skill I would like to improve implementing this project
* Application architecture. I would like to write this project
  implementing Clean Architecture/Hexagonal Architecture/DDD. 
  Generally, implementing maintainable application architecture 
  is a top 1 skill to obtain for me.
* Deal with Typescript. Sometimes, it's hard for me to
  understand how to work properly with Typescript. Sometimes it's a 
  tricky language for me. So I hope to learn it hardly through making
  this project.
* Writing maintainable and readable code. I would like to write my
  code much better and use clean code best practices within this project.
* Unit testing. I have no enough experience with testing, so I hope to
  learn to write good unit/integration tests for my logic. 
* Infrastructure. I want to run all of this stuff with AWS, Docker and
  CI/CD just to understand how to work with it properly.
